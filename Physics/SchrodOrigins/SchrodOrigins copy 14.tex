\begin{abstract}

We present a novel approach to explore semi-classical behavior based on a non-linear classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation which includes a classicality enforcing potential.  Scaling of this non-linear potential is shown to recover linear quantum behavior and is equivalent to scaling Planck's constant.

\section{Introduction}
%
%There is no doubt that quantum mechanics is a linear theory.  [back this up]  There is also no doubt that all the behavior of classical mechanics can be expressed entirely with quantum mechanics.  The Ehrenfest theorem explicitly states this by saying that the expected mean values of measurement predicted from quantum mechanics obey classical Newtonian motion in the classical regime.  
%
%The boundary between where quantum mechanics ends and classical mechanics begins is being pushed by experiments operating far from the microscopic scale in which quantum behavior is normally associated.  For example, Arndt \emph{et al}~\cite{bib:arndt} observed interference between mesoscopic fullerenes and Lee \emph{et al}'s~\cite{bib:leediamonds} experiment entangled the vibrational modes of two macroscopic diamonds.  It is therefore important to be able to describe the manner in which quantum behavior transitions into classical behavior.  However, as quantum mechanics enters the transition area between the classical and quantum regimes it becomes increasingly difficult to represent a quantum system using the full quantum formalism.  It is often unfeasible to model a complex or large quantum system without performing some sort of approximation.  It is for this reason methods such as WKB~\cite{bib:wkb} or Gross-Pitaevskii~\cite{bib:gpg,bib:gpp} were developed which make approximations to quantum theory in order to describe semi-classical behavior.
%
%It is therefore natural to think of classical mechanics as a limit of quantum mechanics.
%
%
%  Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} have recently revisited this notion and were able to instead start with classical mechanics and derive the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.  In doing so they use a non-linear wave equation for classical mechanics derived by Oriols and Mompart~\cite{bib:obm} similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation but which allows none of the quantum or wavelike features associated with quantum mechanics.  Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} argue that to return to quantum mechanics and to recover the Schr\"{o}dinger equation the non-linearity must be eliminated.  We show here that this requirement can be relaxed.  It is not necessary to completely cancel out the non-linearity to recover linear quantum behavior.  We instead modulate the non-linearity and define a transition equation, a possible tool to explore the transition between quantum and classical mechanics.  It is a non-linear equation which nevertheless reproduced all the features of quantum mechanics resulting from the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.   We derive this equation in section~\ref{sec:language} by first expressing the quantum and classical regimes in a consistent language and then modifying Oriols and Mompart's~\cite{bib:obm} non-linear wave equation for classical mechanics.  We then demonstrate the nature of this non-linear equation and its quantum-like behavior by an analytic and numerical analysis.  In section~\ref{sec:scaling} we show that it is equivalent to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a rescaled Planck's constant and in section~\ref{sec:inter} we reinforce this equivalence by numerically exploring the standard single particle interference problem.

%This approach of taking a complete theory such as quantum mechanics and using approximations to describe an approximate one like classical mechanics seems the natural one but Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} have recently taken the opposite tack and derived quantum mechanics starting from classical mechanics.

We derive this equation, which we call the \emph{transition} equation, in section~\ref{sec:language} by first expressing the quantum and classical regimes in a consistent language and then modifying Oriols and Mompart's~\cite{bib:obm} non-linear wave equation for classical mechanics.

%This leads to approximation methods.  Leads to non-linearities.  Leads to the schrod-like equation. O&M took the opposite angle and derived quantum mechanics from classical mechanics.
%
%We propose here a new approximation tool which can be used to describe the physical behavior of a system throughout the entire region between the quantum and classical regimes.  To develop a tool that is useful for exploring the transition between the two regimes, it is prudent to describe the two regimes using the same language.  Here in section~\ref{sec:language} we will focus on describing the regimes using quantum language.  This approach has been taken recently by Oriols and Mompart~\cite{bib:obm} who derived a non-linear wave equation for classical mechanics similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.  The non-linearity in the equation results in the cancelation of all quantum or wavelike features.  The same equation was separately derived by Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} who argue that to return to quantum mechanics and to recover the Schr\"{o}dinger equation the non-linearity must be eliminated.  We show here that this requirement can be relaxed.  It is not necessary to completely cancel out the non-linearity to recover quantum behavior.  We instead modulate the non-linearity and define a transition equation, a tool to explore the transition between quantum and classical mechanics.  To demonstrate the nature of this equation we show analytically in section~\ref{sec:scaling} that it is equivalent to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a rescaled Planck's constant and then in section~\ref{sec:inter} we numerically explore the standard single particle interference problem.

\section{Classical and Quantum Mechanics in a Uniform Language and the Transition Equation\label{sec:language}}

Despite classical non-relativistic mechanics being completely contained in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the two regimes are discussed in quite different languages.  To develop a tool that smoothly transitions between the two regimes we must be able to describe them both using the same language.  Wavefunctions, wave equations and probability densities are the language of quantum mechanics which is governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger wave equation,
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r},t) + V(\mathbf{r},t) \psi(\mathbf{r},t) \;, \label{eqn:schrod}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is a wavefunction whose modulus squared gives a probability density of finding a particle at position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$, $m$ is the mass of the particle, $V$ is the potential experienced by the particle and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.  Classical mechanics on the other hand uses the language of trajectories and is governed by Newton's laws.  We can formulate classical mechanics so that it can be expressed entirely by the Hamilton-Jacobi~\cite{bib:hamiltonjacobi} equation,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial S_{c}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{2 m} \left[\nabla S_{c}(\mathbf{r},t)\right]^2 - V(\mathbf{r},t) \;, \label{eqn:hamjac}
\end{eqnarray}
where $S_{c}$ is the classical action which defines a canonical transformation between initial and final phase-space coordinates.  For a given initial condition the behavior of a classical particle will be described by a trajectory derived wholly~\cite{bib:hamiltonjacobi} from the action $m \dot{v} = \nabla S_{c}$.  

The description of quantum mechanics using classical language or the hydrodynamic form of quantum mechanics has been well known since Madelung~\cite{bib:madelung} in 1926 and was revived by Bohm~\cite{bib:bohm} in 1952.  It begins by expressing the complex-valued wavefunction in its polar form,
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = A(\mathbf{r},t) e^{ i S(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar } \;, \label{eqn:polarwf}
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ is the real-valued amplitude and $S/\hbar$ is the real-valued phase.  Plugging this into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, Eq. (\ref{eqn:schrod}), we obtain two equations.   The first is the continuity equation which expresses the conservation of probability
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial A(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{m} \left[\nabla A(\mathbf{r},t)\right] \cdot [\nabla S(\mathbf{r},t)]  \label{eqn:continuity} \\
&& - \frac{1}{2 m} A(\mathbf{r},t) \nabla^2 S(\mathbf{r},t) \;, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which is equivalent to $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0$ where $\rho = \left| \psi \right|^2=  A^2$ and $\mathbf{j} = \frac{\hbar}{2 i m} (\psi^* \nabla \psi - \psi \nabla \psi^*) = \frac{1}{m }A^2 \nabla S$ is the probability density current. The second is a Hamilton-Jacobi like equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial S(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{2 m} \left[\nabla S(\mathbf{r},t)\right]^2 - \left[ V(\mathbf{r},t) + U(\mathbf{r},t) \right] \;. \label{eqn:hamjacbohm}
\end{eqnarray}
This equation differs in form from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:hamjac}), by an extra potential,
 \begin{eqnarray}
U(\mathbf{r},t) &=& - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{ \nabla^2 A(\mathbf{r},t)}{A(\mathbf{r},t)} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\nabla^2 \left| \psi(\mathbf{r},t) \right|}{\left| \psi(\mathbf{r},t) \right|}  \label{eqn:qmp}
\end{eqnarray}
which Bohm called the \emph{quantum-mechanical potential}.  Adding this potential to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi, Eq. (\ref{eqn:hamjac}), allows us to derive an action which in turn gives a trajectory.  However, unlike a classical trajectory this one can have quantum behavior and non-Newtonian motion.

The description of classical mechanics using quantum language is less well known. If a particle's initial position is only known through a probability distribution $A_c^2(\mathbf{r},0) \,\mathrm{d}^3 r$, the classical trajectories resulting from each of these initial positions r will evolve according to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and give at any time $t>0$ the probability distribution $A_c^2(\mathbf{r},t) \,\mathrm{d}^3 r$. A classical wavefunction similar to Eq.~(\ref{eqn:polarwf}), $\psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) = A_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) \exp\left[i S_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar\right]$, can be constructed where $\hbar$ is used to provide a dimensionless argument and $S_{c}$ is again the classical action from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:hamjac}).  Using this form of the wavefunction Oriols and Mompart~\cite{bib:obm} derive a wave equation, similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, that describes the evolution of a classical particle.  We call it the classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation and it is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) + V(\mathbf{r},t) \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) \label{eqn:class_schrod} \\ 
&&+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\nabla^2 \left| \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) \right|}{\left| \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) \right|} \psi_{c}(\mathbf{r},t) \;, \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where the probability density is given from the modulus squared, $\rho_c = A_c^2 = \left|\psi_{c}\right|^2$, of the wavefunction in analogy to quantum mechanics.  Equation~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod}) while having completely classical behavior is similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation except for an extra non-linear term which has the effect of canceling out all quantum and wave-like effects.  Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} refer to this term as the \emph{classicality-enforcing potential} and it is of course Bohm's quantum-mechanical potential, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:qmp}), with the opposite sign, $-U(\mathbf{r},t)$.  

Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} transfer from the non-linear classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod}),  to the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:schrod}), by first making the anzatz $\psi_{c} \equiv \psi$.   They then define a \emph{quantum action} which includes the classicality-enforcing potential.  This leads to the cancelation of the classicality-enforcing potential in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod}) and recovery of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and quantum mechanics.  Schleich \emph{et al.}~\cite{bib:revisited} claim that to recover quantum mechanics Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod}) must become linear by the complete elimination of the classicality-enforcing potential.  We find that by scaling and not necessarily eliminating the classicality-enforcing potential we can reproduce quantum behavior and recover the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a rescaled Planck's constant.  We insert a \emph{degree of quantumness} $\epsilon$ where $0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1$, into Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod}) which modulates the classicality-enforcing potential and gives  
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) + V(\mathbf{r},t) \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \label{eqn:class_schrod_ep} \\ 
&&+ (1 - \epsilon) \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\nabla^2 \left| \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \right|}{\left| \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \right|} \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \;. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We call this the transition equation.  For $\epsilon = 1$ it is equal to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and $\psi_\epsilon \equiv \psi$.  For $\epsilon = 0$ it is equal to the non-linear classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation and $\psi_\epsilon \equiv \psi_c$.  For all other values $0 < \epsilon < 1$ we show that this non-linear equation exhibits quantum behavior despite the continued presence of the classicality-enforcing potential.

\section{Equivalence to Scaling Planck's Constant\label{sec:scaling}}

The non-linear transition equation can be shown to be equivalent to the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Planck's constant scaled by the degree of quantumness according to
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\hbar} = \hbar \sqrt{\epsilon} \;. \label{eqn:hbar_scaled}
\end{eqnarray}

We define the polar form of the wavefunction that satisfies the transition equation to be
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) &=& A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) e^{ i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar}
\end{eqnarray}
Inserting this into the transition equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod_ep}), and finding the individual elements gives
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla^2 \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) &=& \Big\{ \nabla^2 A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) + 2 \frac{i}{\hbar}  [\nabla A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)] \cdot [\nabla S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)] \nonumber  \\
&+& \frac{i}{\hbar} A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \nabla^2 S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) - \frac{1}{\hbar^2}  A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) [\nabla S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)]^2 \Big\} \nonumber \\
&\times& e^{ i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar } \;,  \label{eqn:cont_laplacian}  \\
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& \left[i \hbar \frac{\partial A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} - A_\epsilon \frac{\partial S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}\right] e^{ i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar } \;, \label{eqn:cont_polar}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\left| \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \right|} \nabla^2 \left| \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) \right| &=& [\nabla^2 A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)] e^{ i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) / \hbar } \;, \label{eqn:cont_cp}
\end{eqnarray}
where Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cont_laplacian}) is the Laplacian, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cont_polar}) is time derivative of the polar wavefunction and Eq.~(\ref{eqn:cont_cp}) is the contribution from the classicality-enforcing potential.

Gathering the real and imaginary terms we obtain the continuity equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:continuity}) with $A$ and $S$ replaced by $A_\epsilon$ and $S_\epsilon$, and an equation very similar to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:hamjac}).  It differs by the addition of Bohm's quantum-mechanical potential scaled by the degree of quantumness,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{\partial S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{2 m} [\nabla S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)]^2  \\
 &&- \left[V(\mathbf{r},t) - \epsilon \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{ \nabla^2 A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}\right] \;. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

This equation can be made to have the appearance of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation by making the substitution $\tilde{\hbar} = \hbar \sqrt{\epsilon}$.   Performing this substitution yields
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{2 m} [\nabla S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)]^2 \label{eqn:hamilton-jacobi_rescaled} \\
&& -\left[V(\mathbf{r},t) - \frac{\tilde{\hbar}^2}{2 m} \frac{ \nabla^2 A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}{A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)}\right] \;, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
by which means the degree of quantumness is cancelled out.  Equations~(\ref{eqn:continuity}) and (\ref{eqn:hamilton-jacobi_rescaled}) are now completely equivalent to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a rescaled $\hbar$ and we can write a scaled Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation and the associated wavefunction
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\psi}(\mathbf{r},t) &\equiv& A_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) e^{i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) / \tilde{\hbar}} \label{eqn:tildewf} \\
&=& \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) e^{i S_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t) (1 / \sqrt{\epsilon} - 1)/\hbar} \;, \\
i \tilde{\hbar} \frac{\partial \tilde{\psi}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}  &=& -  \frac{\tilde{\hbar}^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 \tilde{\psi}(\mathbf{r},t) + V(\mathbf{r},t) \tilde{\psi}(\mathbf{r},t) \;, \label{eqn:scaled_schrod}
\end{eqnarray}
and note that $| \tilde{\psi}(\mathbf{r},t)|^2 = | \psi_\epsilon(\mathbf{r},t)|^2$.  We also note that as $\tilde{\hbar} \rightarrow 0$ the phase of Eq.~\ref{eqn:tildewf} will begin to vary rapidly compared to its amplitude.  This is a necessary assumption of the WKB approximation~\cite{bib:wkb} which leads to accurate results in the semi-classical regime away from the classical turning points.  Sbitnev~\cite{bib:navstoke} also arrived at Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tildewf}) when he derived a theoretical model of a bouncing droplet system~\cite{bib:dropsdiffract}, a macroscopic system which exhibits quantum-like behavior.  He manipulates the classical Navier-Stokes equation to derive an equation similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a Planck's constant replaced by a macroscopic equivalent.  This is equivalent to Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tildewf}) with the appropriate degree of quantumness and therefore the macroscopic bouncing droplet system could also be described by the transition equation.

\section{The Interference of Two Wave Packets\label{sec:inter}}

To further demonstrate the quantum and linear behavior of the non-linear transition equation we will solve it numerically in the context of the standard single particle interference problem.  Interference is not necessarily a uniquely quantum phenomenon.  It can happen with any kind of wave.  However, in the limit of the transition equation becoming classical all wave behavior is suppressed.  Therefore, while not being unique to quantum mechanics, interference can be used as a measure of the quantumness between the two regimes in question.  Using quantum mechanics we would expect two wave packets to spread with time and be represented by the standard Young interference pattern~\cite{bib:Young}.  For classical particles with no wave nature we expect the packets to maintain their shape and not interfere for all time.  For comparison, we must first solve the system using the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

\subsection{Quantum Wave Packet Behavior}

We start the quantum analysis with two gaussians in one dimension with $V = 0$ and initial condition
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi(x,0) &=& \sqrt{N_0} \Big[ e^{-(x-d)^2/4 \sigma^2} +e^{-(x+d)^2/4 \sigma^2}\Big] \label{eqn:double_init}
\end{eqnarray}
where $d$ is the distance from the origin to the centers of the Gaussians and $\sigma$ is the root mean square (rms) width. The normalization is
\begin{eqnarray}
 N_0 = \left[2 \sqrt{2 \pi } \sigma  \left(e^{-d^2/2 \sigma ^2}+1\right)\right]^{-1} \;.
 \end{eqnarray}
Solving the one dimensional time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation,
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} &=& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} \;,
\end{eqnarray}
for this initial condition, the time-dependent wave function is found to be
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi(x,t) &=& \sqrt{\frac{N_0}{a_t}} \left(e^{-(x-d)^2/4 a^2_t}+e^{-(x+d)^2/4 a^2_t}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\psi(x,t) &=& \sqrt{\frac{N_0}{a_t}} \left(e^{-\frac{(x-d)^2}{4 a^2_t}}+e^{-\frac{(x+d)^2}{4 a^2_t}}\right) \;.
%\end{eqnarray}
where $a^2_t =  \sigma^2 + \frac{1}{2} i \hbar t / m$.  When the modulus is squared the interference term becomes obvious,
\begin{eqnarray}
\left| \psi(x,t) \right|^2 &=& \frac{N_0}{\sigma_t} \Bigg[\left(e^{-(x-d)^2/4 a^2_t}+e^{-(x+d)^2/4 a^2_t}\right)^2 \label{eqn:wf_double_t}  \\
&&- 4 e^{-\left(x^2 + d^2\right)/2 \sigma^2_t} \sin^2 \left(\frac{\hbar t x d}{4 m \sigma^2 \sigma^2_t} \right)\Bigg] \;,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sigma^2_t = \hbar^2 t^2 / \left(4 m^2 \sigma^2\right) +\sigma^2$ is the time dependent rms width.  This gives the expected Young interference pattern.

\end{figure}

To explore the transitional behavior of the interference of two Gaussian wave packets from the quantum to the classical regime we use the transition equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod_ep}), in one dimension and with $V = 0$
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_\epsilon(x,t)}{\partial t} &=& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi_\epsilon(x,t)}{\partial x^2}  \label{eqn:schrod_class_nov} \\
&&+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\left| \psi_\epsilon(x,t) \right|} \frac{\partial^2 \left| \psi_\epsilon(x,t) \right|}{\partial x^2} \psi_\epsilon(x,t) \;. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We solve this equation numerically using the explicit finite difference method.  The asymptotic behavior is as expected.  For the case in which the degree of quantumness $\epsilon = 1$ and $\tilde{\hbar} = \hbar$ the interference pattern that forms, Fig.~\ref{fig:diffract_movie}(f), is identical to the analytic case, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:wf_double_t}).  For the case in which $\epsilon = 0$ and $\tilde{\hbar} = 0$ the probability density that forms, Fig.~\ref{fig:diffract_movie}(a), is that of the initial distribution, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:double_init}).  As can be seen in all the frames of Fig.~\ref{fig:diffract_movie} for all values of $\epsilon$ the numerically solved non-linear transition equation is equivalent to the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a scaled $\tilde{\hbar} = \hbar \sqrt{\epsilon}$

Fig.~\ref{fig:diffract_movie} demonstrates the equivalence between the non-linear transition equation, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:class_schrod_ep}), and the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a scaled Planck's constant, Eq.~(\ref{eqn:scaled_schrod}).  For all values of $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$ an interference pattern develops, but the degree of quantumness corresponds to a retardation of the rate in which the interference pattern forms.  Given enough time the pattern will develop into the usual far-field Young interference pattern with a visibility of one for all $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$.  As can be deduced from Fig.~\ref{fig:diffract_movie} the time for a diffraction pattern to develop increases to infinity as degree of quantumness diminishes.  The only value in which no interference is observed is that for $\epsilon = 0$.  When using the transition equation classical mechanics is a special singular case.

\section{Conclusion}

%We have demonstrated both analytically and numerically that it is not necessary to get rid of the classicality-enforcing potential appearing in Oriols and Mompart's~\cite{bib:obm} classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation to recover behavior similar to that of quantum mechanics.  We have found that by using a degree of quantumness to scale but not necessarily eliminate the classicality-enforcing potential we can construct a transition equation, a new tool to explore the transition area between the classical and quantum regimes.  It can be shown to be equivalent to the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation but with a rescaled Planck's constant.  

We have demonstrated both analytically and numerically that it is not necessary to get rid of the classicality-enforcing potential appearing in Oriols and Mompart's~\cite{bib:obm} classical Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation to recover behavior similar to that of quantum mechanics.  We have found that by using a degree of quantumness to scale but not necessarily eliminate the classicality-enforcing potential we can construct a transition equation which can be shown to be equivalent to the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation but with a rescaled Planck's constant.  

A non-linear framework based on the transition equation may potentially serve as a new tool to explore the transition area between the classical and quantum regimes.  Sbitnev~\cite{bib:navstoke} arrived at Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tildewf}) when he derived a theoretical model of a bouncing droplet system~\cite{bib:dropsdiffract}, a macroscopic system which exhibits quantum-like behavior.  He manipulates the classical Navier-Stokes equation to derive an equation similar in form to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a Planck's constant replaced by a macroscopic equivalent.  This is equivalent to Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tildewf}) with the appropriate degree of quantumness and therefore the macroscopic bouncing droplet system could also be described by the transition equation.

It is interesting that the special behavior observed in the linear theory of quantum mechanics can be reproduced with a non-linear wave equation such as the transition equation.  It has been well proven~\cite{bib:qmlinear} that quantum mechanics is absolutely linear.  So too is the transition equation when the degree of quantumness equal to one, however, when the degree of quantumness is anywhere between zero and one, where non-linearity is introduced, quantum behavior is still observed.  The non-linear transition equation mimics the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and pure classical mechanics is only observed for the singular case when the degree of quantumness vanishes completely.

%It is also interesting that pure classical mechanics is only observed for the singular case when the degree of quantumness vanishes completely.  It is more natural to have quantum effects than not.  This is evident when observing the microscopic world as it is very difficult to avoid quantum effects.  It is less obvious for macroscopic experiments, where quantum behavior should be absent.  When these macroscopic experiments are considered in the light of the transition equation it should be noted that quantum behavior is almost never absent and it only needs be teased out.  For experiments that operate in the transition area it is therefore not necessary to make a one-to-one correspondence with quantum mechanics to demonstrate quantum behavior.  The transition equation allows a relaxation of the requirements that an experiment would have abide by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation to be able to say with certainty that quantum behavior was observed.
